This is a brief summary of a research paper by Mina Safwat Haleem entitled جولة في لحن قبطي قديم[^1]

Translations of the hymn 'Rashi Ne - Ραϣι Νε' are quite awkward whether it be in English or Arabic. By looking at the origins of the hymn 

The hymn is constructed according to a Sahidic practice called "the great hermeneutic" where a collection of biblical passages from the Psalms that share a certain keyword are put together. 
<!--excerpt-->
In 'Rashi Ne' the six passages all have the common keyword 'Thelil'.

Below is a reconstruction of the hymn following the aforementioned research paper:

| Common English text | Suggested correction | Coptic | التصحيح المقترح | النص العربي المعتاد |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------ | -------------------- | ----------------|
| Rejoice in God our helper, praise the God of Jacob | sc | c | ac | au |
| Jacob will rejoice, Israel will be glad | sc | c | ac | au |
| We rejoice forever, indeed, and we also implore | sc | c | ac | au |
| Rejoice you vine that is ripe and blossoming | sc | c | ac | au |
| My heart rejoices, my tounge also praises | sc | c | ac | au |
| The dew and the rain and the rejoicing are due to your name | sc | c | ac | au |
