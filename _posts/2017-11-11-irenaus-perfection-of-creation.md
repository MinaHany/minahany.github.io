>If, however, any one say, “What then? Could not God have exhibited man as perfect from 
beginning?” let him know that, inasmuch as God is indeed always the same and unbegotten as respects 
Himself, all things are possible to Him. But created things must be inferior to Him who created them, from 
the very fact of their later origin; for it was not possible for things recently created to have been uncreated. 

<!--excerpt-->

>But inasmuch as they are not uncreated, for this very reason do they come shortof the perfect. Because, as 
these things are of later date, so are they infantile; so are they unaccustomed to, and unexercised in, perfect 
discipline. For as it certainly is in the power of a mother to give strong food to her infant, [but she does not 
do so], as the child is not yet able to receive more substantial nourishment; so also it was possible for God 
Himself to have made man perfect from the first, but man could not receive this [perfection], being as yet 
an infant. And for this cause our Lord in these last times, when He had summed up all things into Himself, 
came to us, not as He might have come, but as we were capable of beholding Him. He might easily have 
come to us in His immortal glory, but in that case we could never have endured the greatness of the glory; 
and therefore it was that He, who was the perfect bread of the Father, offered Himself to us as milk, 
[because we were] as infants. He did this when He appeared as a man, that we, being nourished, as it were, 
from the breast of His flesh,and having, by such a course of milk nourishment, become accustomed to eat 
and drink the Word of God, may be able also to contain in ourselves the Bread of immortality, which is the 
Spirit of the Father.

>Irrational, therefore, in every respect, are they who await not the time of increase, but ascribe to God 
the infirmity of their nature. Such persons know neither God nor themselves, being insatiable and 
ungrateful, unwilling to be at the outset what they have also been created —men subject to passions; but 
go beyond the law of the human race, and before that they become men, they wish to be even now like God 
their Creator, and they who are more destitute of reason than dumb animals [insist] that there is no 
distinction between the uncreated God and man, a creature of to-day. For these, [the dumb animals], bring 
no charge against God for not having made them men; but each one, just as he has been created, gives
thanks that he has been created. For we cast blame upon Him, because we have not been made gods from 
the beginning, but at first merely men, then at length gods; although God has adopted this course out of His 
pure benevolence, that no one may impute to Him invidiousness or grudgingness. He declares, “I have said, 
Ye are gods; and ye are all sons of the Highest.” But since we could not sustain the power of divinity, He
adds, “But ye shall die like men,” setting forth both truths —the kindness of His free gift, and our 
weakness, and also that we were possessed of power over ourselves. For after His great kindness He 
graciously conferred good [upon us], and made men like to Himself, [that is] in their own power; while at 
the same time by His prescience He knew the infirmity of human beings, and the consequences which 
would flow from it; but through [His] love and [His] power, He shall overcome the substance of created 
nature. For it was necessary, at first, that nature should be exhibited; then, after that, that what was mortal 
should be conquered and swallowed up by immortality, and the corruptible by incorruptibility, and that 
manshould be made after the image and likeness of God, having received the knowledge of good and evil.
