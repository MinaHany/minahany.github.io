Orthodox Snippets aims to explore the richness of the Patristic tradition and the beauty of Orthodox Christian worship.

Posts will cover various topics including Patristic and modern Orthodox theology, early Christianity, Christian liturgical worship, iconography, hymnography, and others. Posts are meant to be succinct (hence "snippets" in the name) in order to be accessible and comprehensible.

While employing a blog format, Orthodox Snippets is not exactly a blog: posts will be mostly comprised of quotes from other works rather than self-written posts.
